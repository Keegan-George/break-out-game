# Break Out

## Background
Break Out is a popular arcade game of the 1970s, developed by Atari. In its simplest form, the user controls a paddle and must rebound an incoming ball to break and clear all the coloured bricks. Many different iterations of this game have since been made, each with their own unique mechanics and features. 

In this version, the user must clear all the bricks. With each bounce the ball speed increases slightly. 

## Instructions
1. Run main.py
2. Use the 'left' and 'right' arrow keys on your keyboard to control the paddle.
